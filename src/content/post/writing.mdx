I dont know if i like writing or not though I happen to be witty with words and sentences sometimes.
My whole life to this point of time i may have written 1 or 2 essays out of my heart, that too for mid-term exams while in highschool.

Currently I am enrolled in university[as of **2026**], and in exams these days i happen to write subjective answers to the most technical questions humanly possible.

That is exactly why I have stated multiple times that I have love/hate relationship with language and writing.
All the mails I have written are masterpiece to me personally(*atleast that is what I think*).

People think that I write pretty good(*esp. my friends*), but I dont write pretty often. And I believe this is a phenonmenon from physics called potential energy.
>  potential energy means that energy that is not rendered

But I am trying too, I want to write more , code and learn more.
And I believe doing so has tremendous unseen benefits that are yet to be discovered.

I want to write more, But self doubt clings.
