  ādhāraṃ sarva-vidyānāṃ hayagrīvaṃ upāsmahe ॥

As this is the first time I am publishing my thoughts on open space, I wanted to acknowledge `hayagriva` as the support of all world knowledge.

Since the begining, I was associated with the image of a child prodigy to the people around me, someone who was good with electronic gadgets.
Still to this date, a part of my family sees my ability to work with the computer as a gift of god, something I was born with.

But in reality I am not, because my mother is not a cyborg in disguise. 
I still deal with imposter syndrome to this date because of there is so much for me to learn regarding technology. 

Before I was had no knowledge of such thing as internet, 
Maybe I was fond of english(not in literary terms) which made it easier for me to navigate mobile phone's menu because everything is written in english.<br/>
Mobiles using english as the default language made it easier for me to explore more about both english and techology.
Since every function of a mobiles was documented in english, which made it easier for me to diagnose small issues. 
Which led to people thinking that I can navigate around any issue a mobile faces.


**Cut to now**, I am not a child prodigy and i love it here.
Though I am in stress sometimes, I actually like it here.<br/>

From playing games in black and white nokia phones to becoming a self-taught programmer,this could sound like epitome.
But I am just a mere mortal, and I am seeing myself being pushed into needs and wants by myself. A bit more indulgence day by day.


But for me it is important that i optimize things atleast for my family and give back to the surrounding that crafted me the what i am today and what i will become tomorrow.
